# Littlepay Coding Challenge

# Read Me First
I generated the project using Spring Initializr (https://start.spring.io/) and have included some links below. 
You can build and run the application via the supplied Maven scripts (mvnw and mvnw.cmd for Windows) or your own installed version.

# Running the application
## Compile and run tests
``mvn clean install`` or
``./mvnw clean install``
## Run the application
``mvn spring-boot:run`` or
``./mvnw spring-boot:run``
